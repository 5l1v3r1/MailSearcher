  <H2>Short Bio</H2>
<P>Yifei is a new Ph.D. student in Machine Learning Department in Carnegie Mellon University. Yifei's research interests center around  applying machine learning and optimization techniques to real-life challenges and seeing how they can be improved.  Examples include vision-based intelligent vehicles, locomotion control for  robots, and etc. He has research experiences in theoretical computer science,  dynamic control systems and pattern recognition algorithms. </P>
<p>Yifei has a solid background in math and  programming as well as a wide scope in electrical engineering. He maintains the  1st overall GPA (93.4 on a 100 scale) among 170 students in department of  Automation by the time of graduate school application. In addition, he received a 94% percentile  ranking in the GRE Math Subject test whose examinee body is primarily  math-major students. He was one of the 11 students who fulfilled a dual major in Mathematics in a class of 3000+ students. </p>
<p>Department of Automation in Tsinghua  University intends to educate engineers for research and application of control  solutions to manufacturing industries and robotics. It also focuses on  artificial intelligence, optimization, networking, operations scheduling, and  information integration, since they represent new tools or challenges in the  fast changing workspace and manufacturing methods. </p>
